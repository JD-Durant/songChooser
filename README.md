# Song Chooser for Billy Bot

Tired of having to type every command into Billy Bot? <img align="right" width="150" height="150" src="https://c.tenor.com/e-LsbnNHQ5cAAAAM/catjam-cat-dancing.gif">

Can't think of a song to listen to?

Well this program has you covered!

## What does it do?

Very simple! It'll choose a song from a list you create, copy it to your clipboard, notify you when it has done and after 20 seconds will copy another until the amount you wanted has been complete! 

## How do I make it work?

Glad you asked! There are 2 options you have, either download [Python 3.9.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/) or message me for a compiled .exe of the program!

## Does it come with instructions?

The program is fairly simple how it works! However here is some instructions on how to uses;
```
[1] Put the names of songs you would like to hear on Billy bot in the text file called "songs.txt", this can be located at "Text Files/songs.txt"
[2] Seperate each song by a line but don't leave a blank line anywhere (check the bottom!)
[3] Simple as that! Once you are happy with the songs you've chose, head to Song Chooser which will create a play command for you every 20 seconds and copy it to your clipboard
```

## Developers note

This program is extremely simplistic in nature, but has been built to work as a terminal program, issues are to be expected when running in Python IDLE.
